# Drew's dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and the install script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. The install script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:drewhannay/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source install.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source install.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source install.sh
```

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/drewhannay/blob/main/.aliases#L3-L10)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
# Not in the repository, to prevent people from accidentally committing under my name
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Drew Hannay"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="drew@example.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository. It’s probably better to [fork this repository](https://github.com/drewhannay/dotfiles/fork) instead, though.
